# ESP32 Project: Make an IoT Gadget

This is the repository for the course ESP32 Make an IoT Gadget, from Tech Explorations.

You can find information about this course at https://techexplorations.com/product/esp32iot/

But, here's a summary:

In this course, you will learn how to make an IoT gadget.

You'll use the knowledge you acquired in ESP32 For Busy People.

You'll learn new knowledge so that you can integrate new components and tools.

This course is action-packed, but here are two highlights:

1. You'll use PlatformIO, a fully-featured, modern development environment, running inside Microsoft Visual Studio Code, an excellent graphical programming editor, in the place of the Arduino IDE. Both PlatformIO and MS Code are free applications, and with them, you'll be able to create applications that can take advantage of the capabilities of the ESP32.
2. The gadget that you'll create in this course will make use of three Cloud-based platforms: AdafruitIO, If This Then That, and Google Assistant, to implement modern IoT capabilities.

You can find the details about the objectives and the curriculum of this course in the free lectures in the first section.

As always, the course follows the familiar Tech Explorations format, which includes all schematic wiring diagrams and demo sketches, a logical course structure, high-quality video and audio, and thoughtful and calm delivery. In this course, you can also download the complete PlatformIO project file, which also includes every single Git commit I have made during the recording of the lectures.
